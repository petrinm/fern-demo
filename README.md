Fern! -demo
===========

Simple 2D growing branch demo created for Code+Audio+Graphics 2013 party organized by DOT.(http://dot.ayy.fi/). 
Demo is created using [Processing 2](http://processing.org/)-library and it won the first prize in the demo competition of the party.
Note also that all coding is done in 24 hours so the quality of the code is not good.

Bugs
----

- For some fancy reason branch is always behaving differently. I think jittering and desynchronization between rendering and music is somehow behind this problem.
